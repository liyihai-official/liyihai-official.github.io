This documentation is for the final project of the M.Sc. High Performance Computing.

This project includes a library, a PDE finite difference time domain (FDTD) solver, and a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation.

The library includes:
- A multi-dimension array class,
- A basic MPI Init/Finalize structure,
- An MPI Cartesian Topology class,
- A distributed-multidimensional array class.

The PDE solver includes the capability for solving heat equations in 2D and 3D dimensions with Dirichlet and Von Neumann boundary conditions.
The PDE solver was integrated with three parallel models: one pure MPI and two types of hybrid models.

The PINN includes the capability for learning the patterns based on the generated 2D and 3D datasets of heat equations.
