Requirements
============

If you are using a cluster, make sure you have loaded the right modules. 
This project requires the modules ``cmake-3.1.x``, ``OpenMPI-4.x``, ``gcc-12.x`` and ``cuda-11.8`` at least.

OpenMPI
-------

There are three general phases of using OpenMPI: installing OpenMPI, building MPI applications, and running MPI applications. 
The links below take you to the "Quick start" of OpenMPI documentation.

#. `Quick start: Installing Open MPI <https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/installing-open-mpi/quickstart.html>`_
#. `Quick start: Building MPI applications <https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/building-apps/quickstart.html>`_
#. `Quick start: Launching MPI applications <https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/launching-apps/quickstart.html>`_

OpenMP
------

OpenMP does not require an additional installation. Once you add the header file ``omp.h`` and the compile flag ``-fopenmp``, the program is ready.
You can use the following shell command line:

.. code-block:: shell

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=N

to specify the number of threads, or by calling:

.. code-block:: c

   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(N)

in the main file. 
Please see the official `OpenMP documentation <https://www.openmp.org/resources/tutorials-articles/>`_ if you need further information.

Libtorch
--------

The source files for the ``C++`` API of PyTorch from Meta can be downloaded from the 
`official website <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_. For more information, see the 
`quick start example <https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html>`_.
