                              The connectivity and diagnosability of graphs are two parameters that are closely related to
                               the reliability of interconnection networks. The [g]-good-neighbor connectivity and [g]-good-neighbor 
                               diagnosability are more accurate indexes than the connectivity and diagnosability. The [k]-ary [n]-cube 
                               is one of the most common interconnection networks for multiprocessor systems, and the unidirectional 
                               [k]-ary [n]-cube is the [k]-ary [n]-cube with simplex unidirectional links. This paper shows that the 
                               [1]-good-neighbor connectivity, the diagnosability and the [1]-good-neighbor diagnosability of the 
                               unidirectional [k]-ary [n]-cube under the PMC model are [k(n-1),] [n] and [kn-1,] respectively.

                            Abstract:Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) had been spread nearly all area of 
                            image outline feature extraction in neural networks. This paper proposes and explore 
                            a simple idea is that: Is there exist more efficient method of object outline extraction 
                            comparing to HOG? In this paper we propose and explore a new algorithm of image feature 
                            extraction based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We explicitly solve shorts of HOG 
                            contains the weak capability of different color space, short compute accuracy, long-time 
                            progress and inefficient ability of high-resolution image tasks. Considering the 
                            significant advantage of Discrete Fourier Transform, this algorithm detects the feature 
                            of object in image by switch color space to frequency space and then absorb outline of 
                            object through using different filters. We modify a small Visual Geometry Group Network 
                            (VGG) called Mini-VGG to test 3 separate high frequency filters on Pytorch. 3 separate 
                            high frequency filters (Idea High Pass Filter, Gauss High Pass Filter, Butterworth High 
                            Pass Filter) under different parameters compare to Rectangular-HOG (R-HOG) by Fashion-MINIST 
                            and CIFAR10 clas- sification task on Mini-VGG. This new approach gives a near-perfect 
                            object outline feature extract algo- rithm. Finally, we validate the practice, accuracy, 
                            superior on some suspects. We also make a systematical discussion and the prospect 
                            development of the approach that DFT based object outline extraction.

                            Hurricane, like other natural cataclysms that threaten human life and houses’ damage detection after a 
                            hurricane, is always a problem that needs to be solved. It is vital to retrieving the building damage 
                            status for planning rescue and reconstruction after the cataclysm. In this study, the convolutional neural 
                            networks (CNN) were utilized to identify collapsed buildings from post hurricane satellite imagery with the 
                            proposed workflow. Test accuracy (TeA), training accuracy (TrA), bootstrap algorithm, Grad-CAM, and feature 
                            maps (FM) were used as evaluation metrics. To overcome the imbalance, problems like overfitting, random flip, 
                            random sheer and zoom, and early stopping approach were tested on the investigations. The results demonstrated 
                            that the building collapsed information can be retrieved by utilizing post-event imagery. Simple convolutional 
                            neural network (SCNN) is the standard to compare the other two architectures, which achieved TrA 74.39% and 
                            TeA 76.91%, spend 18.22s per epoch. After adding an additional super resolution block specifically designed. 
                            The super resolution CNN with up sampling (SRCNN-US) reached lower TrA 78.01% but higher TeA 73.80% by 
                            spending nearly 4 times more (78.14s). Moreover, the multi input redesigned SCNN (MICNN) architecture showed 
                            better performance, with TrA value from 74.39% to 84.97% and TeA from 76.91% to 78.81% but consumed only 0.22s 
                            more per epoch. Combining MICNN and SRCNN-US, the MI-SRCNN-US model achieved the highest accuracy on the test 
                            set, 80.36%, and time-consuming, 83.50s/epoch. The 50 times bootstrap investigation shows that the MICNN makes 
                            predictions under more certainty with more accuracy. In subsequent evaluations, Grad-CAM and feature maps also 
                            prove that MICNN pays more attention to the building’s region rather than its surroundings. Therefore, the 
                            suitable method to promote classification performance is by using post-hurricane cataclysm satellite imagery 
                            together with related geographic coordinates information as the input of CNN.
